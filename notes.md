### App Store problems

Do you see the "Your device or computer could not be verified" message when you
try to login to the App Store? If yes, here are the steps to fix it.

* Make sure that your wired ethernet connection is called "en0" (and not "en1" or
something else). Use "ifconfig" command to verify this.

* If the wired ethernet connection is not called "en0", then then go to Network
in System Preferences and delete all the devices, and apply the changes. Next,
go to the console and type in `sudo rm /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist`.
Finally reboot, and then use the App Store without problems.

This fix was found by Glnk2012 of https://www.tonymacx86.com/ site.

Also tweaking the `smbios.plist` file can help (?).

### GPU passthrough notes

These steps will need to be adapted for your particular setup. A host machine
with IOMMU support is required. Consult the Arch Wiki article linked to at the
bottom of this file for exact requirements and other details.

I am running Ubuntu 17.04 on Intel i5-6500 + ASUS Z170-AR motherboard + NVIDIA
1050 Ti.

Tip: Use https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell/nvidia-update to install nVidia
drivers on macOS.

* Enable IOMMU support on the host machine.

  Append the given line to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` in `/etc/default/grub`.

  ##### Intel Systems

  `iommu=pt intel_iommu=on rd.driver.pre=vfio-pci video=vesafb:off,efifb:off`

  ##### AMD Systems

  `iommu=pt amd_iommu=on rd.driver.pre=vfio-pci video=vesafb:off,efifb:off`

* Uninstall NVIDIA drivers from the host machine and blacklist the required modules.

  ```
  $ cat /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
  ... <existing stuff>

  blacklist radeon
  blacklist nouveau
  blacklist nvidia
  ```

* Enable the required kernel modules.

  ```
  # echo "vfio" >> /etc/modules
  # echo "vfio_iommu_type1" >> /etc/modules
  # echo "vfio_pci" >> /etc/modules
  # echo "vfio_virqfd" >> /etc/modules
  ```

* Isolate the passthrough PCIe devices with vfio-pci, with the help of `lspci
  -nnk` command. Adapt these commands to suit your hardware setup.

  ```
  $ lspci -nn
  ...
  01:00.0 ... NVIDIA Corporation [GeForce GTX 1050 Ti] [10de:1c82]
  01:00.1 Audio device: NVIDIA Corporation Device [10de:0fb9]
  03:00.0 USB controller: ASMedia ASM1142 USB 3.1 Host Controller [1b21:1242]
  ```

  ```
  # echo "options vfio-pci ids=10de:1c82,10de:0fb9 disable_vga=1" > /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf
  ```

* Update initramfs, GRUB and then reboot.

  ```
  $ sudo update-grub2
  $ sudo update-initramfs -k all -u
  ```

* Verify that the IOMMU is enabled, and vfio_pci is working as expected.
  Consult Arch Wiki again for help on this. (Often running `lspci -vvv` and
  verifying that the expected devices are using `vfio-pci` as their `Kernel driver in use` is sufficient)

* On the macOS VM, install a NVIDIA Web Driver version which is appropriate for
  the macOS version. Consult http://www.macvidcards.com/drivers.html for more
  information.

  For example, macOS 10.12.5 requires version `378.05.05.15f01` whereas macOS
  10.12.6 requires version `378.05.05.25f01`.

* Boot the macOS VM using the `boot-passthrough.sh` script. At this point, the
  display connected to your passthrough PCIe device should turn on, and you
  should see the Clover boot screen. Using the keyboard, navigate to Options ->
  Graphics Injectord, and enable `Use NVIDIA Web Driver`, then boot macOS.

* Updating SMBIOS for the macOS to `iMac14,2` might be required. I did not do
  so myself.

* To reuse the keyboard and mouse devices from the host, setup "Automatic
  login" in System Preferences in macOS and configure Synergy software.

Note: Many AMD GPU devices (e.g. AMD RX 480 & RX 580) should be natively
supported in macOS High Sierra.

Note: AMD GPU devices may require configuring Clover with `Graphics > RadeonDeInit`
key enabled.


### USB passthrough notes

These steps will need to be adapted for your particular setup.

* Isolate the passthrough PCIe devices with vfio-pci, with the help of `lspci
  -nnk` command.

  ```
  $ lspci -nn
  ...
  01:00.0 ... NVIDIA Corporation [GeForce GTX 1050 Ti] [10de:1c82]
  01:00.1 Audio device: NVIDIA Corporation Device [10de:0fb9]
  03:00.0 USB controller: ASMedia ASM1142 USB 3.1 Host Controller [1b21:1242]
  ```

  Add `1b21:1242` to `/etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf` file in the required format.

* Update initramfs, and then reboot.

  ```
  $ sudo update-initramfs -k all -u
  ```

* Use the helper scripts to isolate the USB controller.

  ```
  $ scripts/lsgroup.sh
  ### Group 7 ###
      00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Sunrise ...
  ### Group 15 ###
      06:00.0 Audio device: Creative Labs Sound Core3D ...
  ### Group 5 ###
      00:17.0 SATA controller: Intel Corporation Sunrise ...
  ### Group 13 ###
      03:00.0 USB controller: ASMedia ASM1142 USB 3.1 Host Controller
  ```

  ```
  $ scripts/vfio-group.sh 13
  ```

* Add `-device vfio-pci,host=03:00.0,bus=pcie.0 \` line to `boot-passthrough.sh`.

* Boot the VM, and devices attached to the ASMedia USB controller should just work under macOS.


### Synergy Notes

* Get Synergy from https://sourceforge.net/projects/synergy-stable-builds.

  I installed "synergy-v1.8.8-stable-MacOSX-x86_64.dmg" on the macOS guest and
  configured it as a client.

  For automatically starting Synergy on macOS, add Synergy to "Login Items",
  System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> Select your user account -> Login Items
  -> Add a login item

* On the Linux host machine, install "synergy-v1.8.8-stable-Linux-x86_64.deb"
  or newer, configure `~/.synergy.conf` and run `synergys` command.

* The included `.synergy.conf` will need to be adapted according to your setup.


### Higher Resolution (for "UEFI + Clover")

Follow the steps below to get a higher resolution:

1. Set the desired Clover screen resolution in the relevant
   `config.plist.stripped.qemu` file and regenerate the corresponding
   `Clover*.qcow2` file (process documented in `Mojave/README.md`).

2. Ensure that the OVMF resolution is set equal to resolution set in your
   Clover.qcow2 file (default is 1024x768). This can be done via the OVMF menu,
   which you can reach with a press of the ESC button during the OVMF boot logo
   (before Clover boot screen appears). In the OVMF menu settings, set Device
   Manager -> OVMF Platform Configuration -> Change Preferred Resolution for Next
   Boot to the desired value (default is 1024x768). Commit changes and exit the
   OVMF menu.

3. Relaunch the boot script.


### Accelerated Graphics

Install VMsvga2 from [this location](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vmsvga2/). No support
is provided for this unmaintained project!

* Add `-vga vmware` to QEMU parameters in the booot script (e.g.
  boot-macOS.sh), if required.

* For Clover bootloader, add `wmv_option_fb=0x06` to the `<string>` tag of the
  `Arguments` key of the `config.plist` you use when generating the
  `CloverNG.qcow2`.

* See `UEFI/README.md` for GPU passthrough notes.

* Note: There is no working QXL driver for macOS so far.


### Virtual Sound Device

*Warning: The OpenCore distribution that comes with OSX-KVM already has
AppleALC, do not mix VoodooHDA with AppleALC. You may want to consider HDA
passthrough if it is practical or use HDMI audio instead*

No support is provided for this. You are on your own. The sound output is known
to be choppy and distorted.

* Add `-device ich9-intel-hda -device hda-duplex` to the VM configuration.
  `boot-macOS.sh` already has this change.

* To get sound on your virtual Mac, enable the `VoodooHDA OC` driver in
  OpenCore configuration. The emulated sound quality is not usable (it seems?).

  Note: Use Sound Card / USB Sound Card passthrough instead.

Note: It seems that playback of Flash videos requires an audio device to be
present.


### Building QEMU from source

See http://wiki.qemu-project.org/Hosts/Linux for help.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kholia/qemu.git

$ cd qemu

$ git checkout macOS

$ ./configure --prefix=/home/$(whoami)/QEMU --target-list=x86_64-softmmu --audio-drv-list=pa

$ make clean; make; make install
```


### Connect iPhone / iPad to macOS guest

Please passthrough a PCIe USB card to the virtual machine to be able to connect
iDevices (iPhone / iPad) to it.


### Exposing AES-NI instructions to macOS

Add `+aes` argument to the `-cpu` option in `boot-macOS.sh` file.

``` diff
diff --git a/boot-macOS.sh b/boot-macOS.sh

```

Other host CPU features can be similarly exposed to the macOS guest.

The following command can be used on macOS to verify that AES-NI instructions are exposed,

```
sysctl -a | grep machdep.features
```

On machines with OpenSSL installed, the following two commands can be used to
check AES-NI performance,

```
openssl speed aes-128-cbc

openssl speed -evp aes-128-cbc  # uses AES-NI
```


### Exposing AVX and AVX2 instructions to macOS

Exposing AVX and AVX2 instructions to macOS requires support for these
instructions on the host CPU.

The `boot-clover.sh` script already exposes AVX and AVX2 instructions to the
macOS guest by default. Modify or comment out the `MY_OPTIONS` line in
`boot-clover.sh` file in case you are having problems.

To enable AVX2, do the following change,

`Clover boot menu -> Options -> Binaries patching -> Fake CPUID -> 0x0306C0  # for Haswell`

For details, see [this wiki](https://clover-wiki.zetam.org/Configuration/KernelAndKextPatches) page.

Once enabled, the following commands can be used to confirm the presence of AVX
and AVX2 instructions on the macOS guest.

```
$ sysctl -a | grep avx
hw.optional.avx2_0: 1
hw.optional.avx1_0: 1

$ sysctl -a | grep leaf7
machdep.cpu.leaf7_features: SMEP BMI1 AVX2 BMI2
machdep.cpu.leaf7_feature_bits: 424
```


### Running Docker for Mac

Docker for Mac requires enabling nested virtualization on your host machine,

```
modprobe -r kvm_intel
modprobe kvm_intel nested=1
```

Also you have to add `vmx,rdtscp` arguments to the `-cpu` option in
`boot-macOS.sh` file.


### Using virtio-blk-pci with macOS

Newer macOS (namely Mojave+) have support for some virtio drivers.

This can be enabled by applying the following change to `boot-macOS-NG.sh` to
get some performance gain.

```diff
-         -device ide-hd,bus=sata.4,drive=MacHDD \
+         -device virtio-blk-pci,drive=MacHDD \
```


### Permission problems with libvirt / qemu?

```
sudo setfacl -m u:libvirt-qemu:rx <path>  # fix virt-manager perm problems
```


### Extract .pkg files

* http://mackyle.github.io/xar/ is unmaintained and may fail for many `.pkg` files.

* Use a modern version of `7-Zip` instead.

  ```
  7z l example.pkg

  7z x example.pkg

  gunzip -c <something>.pkg/Payload | cpio -i
  ```


### QEMU quits with `gtk initialization failed`

Append the `display=none` argument to your QEMU execution script (this has
already been done for `boot-passthrough.sh`)


### ISO/DMG (`createinstallmedia` generated) install medium not detected

In OpenCore's `config.plist` and set `ScanPolicy` to `0` ([For more information, check the Dortania Troubleshooting Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html#can-t-see-macos-partitions))


### Attach physical drive to QEMU VM

*Note: If using NVMe, passing the controller may be a better option then passing it as a block device*

Run `ls -la /dev/disk/by-id/` to get the unique mapping for the device you want to attach to the VM (like `sda`, `sdb`, `nvme0n1`, while you can attach only a partition like `sda1`, this is not recommended)

```
$ ls -la /dev/disk/by-id
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 360 Jul 29 08:14 .
drwxr-xr-x 8 root root 160 Jul 29 08:14 ..

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  10 Jul 29 08:14 wwn-0xffffffffffffffff-part2 -> ../../sda2
```

Then edit your QEMU launch script and add these lines (adapt to it your
hardware), then launch the script using `sudo` (because you cannot write to a
block device without `root` permissions)

```
-drive id=NVMeDrive,if=none,file=/dev/disk/by-id/nvme-Samsung_SSD_960_EVO_512GB_FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF,format=raw \
-device ide-hd,bus=sata.4,drive=NVMeDrive \
```


### Run the Virtual Machine on Boot

* Edit your QEMU launch script and set the absolute path of `OSX-KVM` as the
  value of `REPO_PATH`

* Edit `/etc/rc.local` and add the absolute path of the script (with or without
  `sudo` depending on your needs) to the bottom of the script.


### Setup SSH for internal remote access

Presuming your network interface has a statically defined internal IP (on Ubuntu).

```
$ sudo apt install openssh-server -y
$ sudo ufw allow ssh
$ sudo update-rc.d ssh defaults
$ sudo systemctl enable ssh
$ sudo systemctl enable ssh.socket
$ sudo systemctl enable ssh.service
```


### Improve performance on AMD GPUs

*Note: As of July 2020, Navi10/14 firmware has been disabled on macOS > 10.15.5
due to broken SMU firmware*

Consider using CMMChris's [RadeonBoost.kext](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tired-of-low-geekbench-scores-use-radeonboost.2231366/) for the RX480, RX580, RX590 and Radeon VII GPUs.


### USB passthrough notes

#### USB 3.0 flash drive

The following USB configuration works for usb passthrough of a USB 3.0 flash
drive to Fedora 25 guest.

    -device nec-usb-xhci,id=xhci \
    -device usb-host,bus=xhci.0,vendorid=0x0781,productid=0x5590 \
    -usb -device usb-mouse,bus=usb-bus.0 -device usb-kbd,bus=usb-bus.0 \
    ...

#### Moto G3 phone

The following USB configuration works for usb passthrough of a Moto G3 phone to
Fedora 25 guest.

    -device usb-host,bus=usb-bus.0,vendorid=0x22b8,productid=0x002e \
    -usb -device usb-mouse,bus=usb-bus.0 -device usb-kbd,bus=usb-bus.0 \
    ...

#### CoolerMaster keyboard

The following USB configuration works for usb passthrough of a CoolerMaster
keyboard to macOS Sierra guest!

    -device usb-host,bus=usb-bus.0,vendorid=0x2516,productid=0x0004 \
    -usb -device usb-tablet,bus=usb-bus.0 -device usb-kbd,bus=usb-bus.0 \
    ...


#### Virtual USB disk

The following USB configuration works for attaching a virtual USB disk to macOS
Sierra guest. Use "qemu-img" to create "disk.raw" virtual disk.

    -drive if=none,id=usbstick,file=disk.raw,format=raw \
    -device usb-storage,bus=usb-bus.0,drive=usbstick \
    ...

However USB passthrough of EHCI, and XHCI (USB 3.0) devices does not work with
macOS Sierra. See https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1509336 for
confirmation. According to this bug report, USB passthrough does not work with
versions >= Mac OS X El Capitan guests.

It seems that this problem can be fixed by using OVMF + Clover.

Update: OVMF + Clover doesn't help. It seems that macOS is missing the required
drivers for the EHCI, and XHCI controllers that are exposed by QEMU.


### Generate macOS Mojave / Catalina installation ISO.

  This step currently needs to be run on an existing macOS system.

  ```
  cd ~/OSX-KVM/scripts

  ./create_dmg_catalina.sh
  ```


### Tweaks for macOS

1. Disable `Energy Saver` in `System Preferences`.

2. Disable `Screen Saver` in `System Preferences -> Desktop & Screen Saver`.

3. Turn off indexing using the following command.

   ```
   sudo mdutil -a -i off
   ```

4. Enable `Remote Login` (aka SSH) via `System Preferences -> Sharing`.


### Snapshot Debugging Tips

- Get `savevm` to work:

  ```
  (qemu) savevm
  Error while writing VM state: No space left on device
  ```

  Ensure that you have plenty of free space in `/var/tmp` and `/`.


  To use a separate storage location for storing snapshots, use the following
  trick (from `zimbatm`):

  ```
  export TMPDIR=$PWD/tmp
  ```


### 'Fix' weird boot problems

```
cp OVMF_VARS-1024x768.fd.bak OVMF_VARS-1024x768.fd
```


### 'Fix' time drift problems

Run the following command periodically from root's crontab:

```
sntp -S pool.ntp.org
```
